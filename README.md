# Identifying Natural Disasters using aerial Images 

We will be using RGB aerial images from NASA earth observatory which is satellite images of various resolutions and the images are labelled as the disaster type like storms, droughts, wildfire etc.

How we are going to do it?

We'll be using Deep Learning more specifically Convolutional Neural Nets to classify Disaster Images For classes like storms and wildfires, and more dominant instead of trying training our model from scratch, we will use transfer learning method and will try on architectures like resnet, VGGNet to get the better accuracy.
